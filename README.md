Maze Adventure- The legend of Zelda

I tried to instantiate the maze as a tree data structure, but the traversing really didn’t make sense to me for this specific game as the connections were not possible in 4 direction traversal. Thus, I switched to a graph-based data structure to instantiate the maze. I wanted to play around with randomly placing objects each time, which I’ll try doing later but for now the positions of the objects and places have been hardcoded. The easy part was the interaction with objects as it was similar to the first lab assignment we had.
